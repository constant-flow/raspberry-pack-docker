# Docker â€“ Raspberry-Pack

This image allows to install docker on a Raspberry Pi. The image that will run is defined by the user at installation of the Pi

## How to use

- Get Raspberry-Pack ([clone & install & run](https://github.com/constant-flow/raspberry-pack#getting-started))
- Add this project's git-url (`git@github.com:constant-flow/raspberry-pack-docker.git`) as a remote package

## How to run docker with this

- First you can provide a url to a repository. Here you can put all files that can be used by the Dockerfile `DOCKER_FILES_GIT`. They will be created in `/home/pi/dockerfiles`.
- After this the packages runs the `docker run --rm [A]` command where:
  - `[A]` = `DOCKER_RUN_PARAMETERS`: are the options to run the image with (e.g. `-d -p 80:80 alpine`)

## Example: Host a static website with Apache from a git repo (containing website only)

Using it straight with docker would mean to call it

**ðŸš« without raspberry-pack**

```
cd /home/pi/
git clone https://github.com/[user-or-group]/[project-with-static-website] dockerfiles
docker run -dit --name my-apache-app -p 80:80 -v "/home/pi/dockerfiles/":/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd:2.4-alpine
```

**âœ… with raspberry-pack**

You can reach the same result by answering the questions:

- **Provide a repo-url where the files are located which you can mount** : `https://github.com/[user-or-group]/[project-with-static-website]`
- **What should docker run? Fill what is behind 'docker run --rm'** : `https://github.com/[user-or-group]/[project-with-static-website] --name my-app -p 80:80 -v "/home/pi/dockerfiles/":/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd:2.4-alpine`
